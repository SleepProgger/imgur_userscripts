imgur_userscripts
=================

This is a collection of userscripts to add some features to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com).
They are designed to be used with the [Greasemonkey (firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Tampermonkey (chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) plugin.


**Every script except these with the postfix "_light" and/or explicit mentioned, need the [imgur_helper.user.js](scripts/imgur_helper.user.js) script.**  
Everything else is compatible and optional.


**INSTALL:**  
1. Install [Greasemonkey (firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Tampermonkey (chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) if not already installed.  
2. Install the [imgur_helper.user.js](scripts/imgur_helper.user.js) (Except you only want to use "_light" scripts).  
To install any script visit the github page and click on the "RAW" button. Your browser should now ask you if you want to install this script.  
3. Install any other script you like.


**Settings**  
All script settings (except for _light scripts) are located at the imgur settings.  
Other scripts might add additional buttons.

**Hide user**
This [script](scripts/imgur_hide_user.user.js) hides comments from selected users.  
Hide user by selecting the comment menu (little green arrow) and press "Hide user".

Unhide via the mod settings.  
The settings are saved locally.  
If you want to copy your settings from one system to another use the export/inport function in the mod settings.  

**User comment to top**
This [script](scripts/imgur_top_user.user.js) behaves exactly the same as the "Hide user" script except it moves all comments from selected users to the top.
